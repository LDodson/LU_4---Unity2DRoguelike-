# LU_4---Unity2DRoguelike-
This is the 4th lesson I've gone through in learning Unity 5.6 and my first attempt at using Github with a Unity project.  I will be keeping a journal of my progress here as I complete the tutorial.  I will also include notes on my modifications and any thoughts or inspirations I gain from the experience.
